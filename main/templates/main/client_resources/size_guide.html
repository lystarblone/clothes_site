    <h2 class="mission-title">How to Measure Yourself</h2>
    <p>
        To get accurate measurements, use a soft measuring tape and follow these steps:
    </p>

    <div class="measurement-guide">
        <img src="{% static 'main/img/measurement_guide.png' %}" alt="Measurement Guide" class="measurement-image">
    </div>

    <ol class="mission-list">
        <li><strong>Chest:</strong> Measure around the fullest part of your chest, keeping the tape horizontal. Make sure it’s snug but not too tight.</li>
        <li><strong>Waist:</strong> Measure around your natural waistline, which is typically above your belly button. Keep the tape snug but comfortable.</li>
        <li><strong>Hips:</strong> Measure around the fullest part of your hips, keeping the tape parallel to the floor. Stand with your feet together for the most accurate measurement.</li>
        <li><strong>Arm Length:</strong> Measure from the top of your shoulder (where your arm meets your body) down to your wrist. Bend your arm slightly for a more natural measurement.</li>
        <li><strong>Inseam (for pants):</strong> Measure from the top of your inner thigh down to your ankle. Alternatively, measure a pair of pants that fit you well, laying them flat and measuring along the inseam.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        <em>Pro Tip:</em> If you don’t have a measuring tape, you can use a piece of string or ribbon, then measure it against a ruler.

    <h2 class="mission-title">Tips for Choosing the Right Size</h2>
    <ul class="mission-list">
        <li><strong>Between Sizes?</strong> If your measurements fall between two sizes, we recommend choosing the larger size for a more comfortable fit.</li>
        <li><strong>Layering:</strong> Keep in mind that winter clothing is often worn with layers. If you plan to wear thick sweaters or thermals underneath, consider sizing up.</li>
        <li><strong>Fabric Stretch:</strong> Some items may have stretchy fabric. Check the product description for details on material flexibility.</li>
        <li><strong>Personal Preference:</strong> If you prefer a looser or tighter fit, adjust your size choice accordingly.</li>
    </ul>
